What this project does

This project allowsus to redesign our original portfolios to show our growing skill set and personalities!

Technical approach

I enjoyed working with Materialize on our group project, so even thought I started with one of their templates, I navigated through their CSS, cards, and parralax setup to customize it. 

Why the project is useful

This project demonstrates our growing skills and gives us the opportunities to focus on beginning to present out work to future employers. It also gave me the needed push I need to begin to review previous projects, start to consider refactoring, and learn how I can begin to present my experience from the program.
